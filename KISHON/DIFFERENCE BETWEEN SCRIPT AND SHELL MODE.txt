Difference Shell Mode and Script Mode:-

Overview:
       Shell mode and script mode are two different ways to interact with a command-line interface (CLI) or a shell. Understanding the differences between these modes is essential for effective shell usage.

Shell Mode:

  * Interactive mode
  * Commands are executed immediately
  * Output displayed on the screen
  * Variables and settings are lost when session ends
  * Error handling is immediate
  * Suitable for exploratory and ad-hoc tasks

Script Mode:

  * Non-interactive mode
  * Commands are executed in batch
  * Output can be redirected to files
  * Variables and settings persist throughout script execution
  * Error handling can be customized
  * Suitable for automation, repetitive tasks, and complex workflows

Key Differences:

  1. Interaction: Shell mode is interactive, while script mode is non-interactive.
  2. Command Execution: Shell mode executes commands immediately, whereas script mode executes commands in batch.
  3. Output Handling: Shell mode displays output on the screen, whereas script mode allows output redirection.
  4. Variable Persistence: Script mode preserves variables throughout execution, whereas shell mode loses variables when the session ends.
  5. Error Handling: Script mode allows customized error handling, whereas shell mode provides immediate error handling.

Use Cases:

  * Shell Mode: Exploratory data analysis, quick testing, and ad-hoc tasks.
  * Script Mode: Automation, data processing pipelines, and complex workflows.
